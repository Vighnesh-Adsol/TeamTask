# TaskView


## About
**TeamTask** is a web application made for group project management, which includes adding tasks and jobs accoeding to the groups job allocation.
This helps in understanding and managing the chronology of the project sub-tasks so that every member of the group can handle their own side with admiration.

This was the team effort made possible by combining the ideas and technical understanding of my peers.

## Why This Idea?
The answer of this question can differ from other perspectives but from my side, I think some groups like mine sometime doesn't understand the overly complicated technologies such as git and GitHub for project management. We tend to work along with the flow where the only complicated thing we work with is our own code. I agree that git and GitHub are really appreciable technologies, I like using them too. But my concern is there maybe people who don't understand such techsavy stuff. And along with that, they might not hae the time to learn all that while learning their tech stack. This concludes the reason for the website.
